  <h3>What is PlotPDX?</h3>

  <p>PlotPDX is a community website where locals can vote on how open lots should be developed. Users propose uses for an open lot  and the community votes yes or no if they like the idea or not. Voters see real-time results of all votes. Community members can propose multiple land uses at one address. After voting, users will have the option to provide basic demographic information about themselves.</p>

  <p>PlotPDX was created during a Build-a-thon hosted by University of Oregonâ€™s Agora Journalism Center in the White Stag building.</p>
