  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>What is this?</h3>
  <p>PlotPDX is an online database of open lots where the public can vote on a curated list of the best uses for these spaces. Voters see a real-time update on what option has the most support. </p>


  <h3>Why did we do this?</h3>
  <p>PlotPDX believes that public data should be easily accessible to the community. We believe that the public should be informed about new projects in their area, and have a voice in the development of their community. </p>


  <h3>How do we do it?</h3>
  <p>We import municipal data and present the information in easy to view maps.</p>


  <h3>How do you transform a vacant lot? </h3>
  <p>Process adopted from City of Milwaukee Vacant Lot Handbook.</p>

  <h4>STEP ONE: IDENTIFY THE LOT. </h4>
  <p>Use the PlotPDX to identify a city-owned or privately owned vacant lot. If you would like more information on the lot history, visit portlandmaps.com.</p>

  <h4>STEP TWO: IDENTIFY EXPECTATIONS</h4>
  <p>Think about your long term plan for the underutilized building or vacant lot. </p>

  <h4>STEP THREE: CHECK THE ZONING AND BUILDING CODES</h4>
  <p>PlotPDX has made this process easy for you, check out the details of the lot to get current zoning information. If you would like more information on the zoning, building codes and development fees, visit portlandmaps.com, and/or call the Cityâ€™s Permit Center. </p>

  <h4>STEP FOUR: DEVELOP YOUR IDEA </h4>
  <p>Use the PlotPDX to propose an idea for the vacant lot.</p>

  <h4>STEP FIVE: FIND RESOURCES AND ORGANIZE</h4>
  <p>If needed, get help from the City, nonprofits, or professionals willing to donate their time. Set up a Change.org peittion or a crowdfunding captial campaign. </p>


  <h4>STEP SIX: BUY LOT OR OBTAIN PERMIT</h4>
  <p>To put up a permanent structure you must buy the land. Otherwise, you can obtain a temporary use permit for interim use. Set up a meeting with City Facilities Services - formerly Bureau of General Services to actually make the vacant lot purchase or obtain a temporary use permit based on the approved plan. Contact the Portland Development Commission to learn more about development programs. </p>

  <h4>STEP SEVEN: BUILD YOUR IDEA! </h4>
